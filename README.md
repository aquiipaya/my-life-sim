# Life as a Thermodynamic Regulator: Rewiring of Dissipation Channels and Phase Transitions in an Agent-Based Model

This repository contains the official source code and the research manuscript for the study on life as a thermodynamic regulator.

## 📌 Priority Claim / Time-stamp
- [cite_start]**Author**: Akihiko Itaya [cite: 2]
- [cite_start]**Affiliation**: Independent Researcher [cite: 3]
- **Date**: January 17, 2026
- [cite_start]**Status**: Pre-arXiv submission (Manuscript included in this repository for priority establishment) [cite: 8, 126]

## 🔬 Research Overview
[cite_start]This study challenges the traditional view of life as a mere dissipative structure[cite: 1, 10]. [cite_start]By using an agent-based model, we demonstrate that biological agents do not just accelerate entropy production but qualitatively transform how dissipation occurs[cite: 6, 12].

### Key Findings
* [cite_start]**Dissipation Rewiring**: Biological agents can suppress physical diffusive frictional heat ($heatDiff$) by up to 97%[cite: 7, 77].
* [cite_start]**Thermodynamic Regulation**: Life acts as a regulator that reorganizes dissipation channels to stabilize non-equilibrium environments[cite: 8, 127].
* [cite_start]**Phase Transition**: We identified a phase transition separating "suppression" and "acceleration" regimes based on inflow and consumption rates[cite: 100, 126].

## 📂 Repository Contents
- [cite_start]`App.tsx`: The core simulation engine (Strictly adjusted for the thermodynamic calculations described in Section 2)[cite: 14].
- [cite_start]`Life_as_a_Thermodynamic_Regulator.pdf`: The full research manuscript[cite: 1].
- [cite_start]`src/`: Source code for the agent-based model including spatial energy diffusion and metabolic logic[cite: 16, 22].

## 🛠 Model Parameters (Section 3)
The simulation allows for the exploration of:
- [cite_start]**Inflow Rate**: Energy input into the system[cite: 34].
- [cite_start]**Consumption Rate**: Metabolic cost for agents[cite: 34].
- [cite_start]**Grid Size**: Spatial domain of the simulation[cite: 16].
